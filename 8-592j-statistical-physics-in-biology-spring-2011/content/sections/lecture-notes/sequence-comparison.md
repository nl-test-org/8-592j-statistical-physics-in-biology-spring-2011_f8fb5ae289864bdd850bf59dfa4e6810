1.  Sequence comparison
    1.  Protein sequences: [amino acids](http://jenalib.fli-leibniz.de/IMAGE_AA.html) and their properties
    2.  Why do we need to compare sequences?
        *   Find dissimilarities
        *   Similar sequences = similar properties
        *   Similar sequences = common ancestral genes
    3.  Mutations -> Gapless alignments
    4.  Mutations, insertions and deletions -> Gapped alignment
2.  Sequence alignments
    1.  [Score = edit distance](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/assignments/sequence.html)
    2.  Examples of scores
    3.  Length of alignment, number of alignments
3.  Algorithms for sequence alignments
    1.  Dynamics programming
    2.  Example
    3.  Global and Local alignments
4.  [BLAST](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/)
    1.  How it works
    2.  Examples
