1.  Interacting polymers:
    *   Entropy; excluded volume; and solvent-mediated interactions
    *   Mean-field estimate of the partition function
2.  Swollen (coil) phase in good solvents
    *   Flory exponent
    *   Scaling behavior in other dimensions
3.  Compact (globular) phase in poor solvents
    *   Polymer collapse, theta-point
    *   Thermodynamic behavior at the transition; reduction in entropy
4.  Frozen (folded) state of heteropolymers
    *   The Random Energy Model (REM)
    *   The freezing transition and associated singularities
    *   Designed REM as a model of protein folding
